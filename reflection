How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Don't no. Never programmed on a bigger projekt.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
You can forget to commit and have to restart from the "begining".
Commits are more meaningful.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is desinged for programming. Google docs not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log I can see the commits and with diff I can see the details.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
I little bit. Usually STRG+z is nice too. ;)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For my programming tasks in university and if i like it, for many other things.
